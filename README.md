# Healthcare Chatbot: Enhancing Accessibility with NLP and Machine Learning

## Overview

This project was developed as part of a 6-week **Summer Research Internship** at the **Centre for Data Science and Applied Machine Learning (CDSAML)**, PES University. The primary goal was to build a smart, accessible, and interactive **Healthcare Chatbot** that can assist users with symptom analysis, disease prediction, medication suggestions, and nearby hospital recommendationsâ€”all through a simple and user-friendly interface.

## ðŸ”§ Features and Components

- **Flask-Based User Interface**  
  Developed a responsive web interface using Flask, allowing users to interact seamlessly with the chatbot in real time.

- **Symptom Extraction with NLP (SpaCy)**  
  Leveraged **SpaCy** to extract medical symptoms from free-text user input using natural language processing techniques.

- **Disease Prediction using Naive Bayes**  
  Implemented a **Naive Bayes classifier** to predict possible diseases based on the extracted symptoms.

- **Healthcare Support Information**  
  The chatbot provides:
  - Suggested **medications** for predicted conditions.
  - Information on **nearby hospitals** based on user location for immediate support.

- **User Data Management with MySQL**  
  - Stored **login credentials** securely.
  - Maintained a **history of past predictions** for each user to enable personalized healthcare tracking.

## ðŸ“ˆ Achievements

- **High Model Accuracy**: Achieved **95% accuracy** within just **five training epochs**.
- **Efficient Symptom Recognition**: Captured **96.2%** of symptoms with only **3.8% information loss**.
- **Improved Prediction with Multiple Inputs**: Achieved **93.3% accuracy** when five symptoms were provided.

## ðŸ“š Research Contribution

This demonstrates how **NLP and machine learning** can be effectively combined to deliver **patient-centric, intelligent healthcare tools**. The chatbot enhances healthcare accessibility while maintaining high standards of accuracy and efficiency.

This chatbot project is a stepping stone toward transforming digital healthcare by enabling proactive, data-driven support systems for users.
